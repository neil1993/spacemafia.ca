I'm Neil. Welcome to the Space Mafia blog.

The purpose of this blog is simply to serve as a structured dumping ground for my projects, research and writings. I'm going to be writing primarily on the space and space launch industries, especially in Canada, but I'll branch into rocket engineering and defence if it interests me.
